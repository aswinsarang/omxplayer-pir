# omxplayer-pir

A motion activated video player.

As the player is using OMXPlayer, one can also play sound only (e.g. MP3 file),
and therefore making this a motion activated audio player as well.

Any digital (On/Off) signal can be used to trigger the player.
E.g. connect a button to the GPIO in stead of a PIR sensor.

Therefore more generic, this is a digital trigger activated video/audio/sound player.

## Introduction

This python program has been written as an example for a [Motion activated video player 
(PIR sensor)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=121456).

When someone approaches the video player, a video is played. When that someone walks away,
the video is stopped.

A PIR (motion) sensor is used to control the playing of the video.

When the PIR sensor detects motion, the video is started to play. When the PIR sensor 
does no longer detects motion, the video is stopped.

The (single) video is played in a loop.

The program runs on a Raspberry Pi.

Upon startup, the program waits until the operator leaves the scene. Once the operator
has left the scene the fun starts.

The program is terminated with Ctrl+C.

## Usage

To run the program<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo python omxplayer-pir.py FILE<br>
where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILE is the name of the file to play.

The program is terminated by CTRL+C.

## Details

### PIR (motion) sensor

PIR stands for Passive Infra Red. A PIR sensor detects the change of the
infra red signature of its environment.

The PIR sensor is connected to a GPIO.

The PIR sensor signals with
* a LOW (/Off) signal that there is no motion detected,<br>
* a HIGH (/On) signal that motion has been detected.

### The video player (OMXPlayer)

The playing of the video is done with OMXPlayer.

When running OMXPlayer, it directly starts playing the video. OMXPlayer doesn't
have the ability to load (only) the video and start the (loaded) video with
a (play) command. 

However, OMXPlayer has a Pause command. This command pauses the video playing, and unpauses
(resumes) the paused video.

To overcome the load/play shortcoming, OMXPlayer is started and directly paused.

When motion is detected, the OMXPlayer is commanded to unpause the paused video.
When there is no motion detected anymore, OMXPlayer is commanded to pause the playing video.

### GPIO

The GPIO support is done with python module 'RPi.GPIO'.

## History
* V0.10 Initial version
* V0.11 Added video file exists check.
* V0.12 Changed 'waiting for PIR ready' into 'waiting for operator leaving the scene'.
* V0.13 Name of the file to play is now a commandline argument.
* V0.14 The python commands needs omxplayer-pir.py, so with the .py, the python script file extension.
        Checking the number of arguments as when given no FILE argument the
        "IndexError: list index out of range" appears.
